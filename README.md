How to Use
----------

`play-info` can be easily installed as an executable. Download the latest [compiled binaries](https://github.com/yelinaung/play-info/releases/tag/v0.0.1) and put it anywhere in your executable path.

Or, if you've done Go development before and your $GOPATH/bin directory is already in your PATH:


```bash
$ go get github.com/yelinaung/play-go
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/yelinaung/play-info
$ go run play-info.go "com.yelinaung.programmerexcuses"
```
